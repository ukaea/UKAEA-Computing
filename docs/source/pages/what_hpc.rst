Definition of HPC
=================

"High Performance Computing most generally refers to the practice of aggregating computing power
in a way that delivers much higher performance than one could get out of a typical desktop computer 
or workstation in order to solve large problems in science, engineering, or business."

Supercomputers and clusters
===========================

Supercomputers are able to process capabilities nearly as big as anyone can build at a "given time" (supercomputers of yesteryear aren't that super any more). Supercomputers are couple parallel computers as clusters are, and both are interconnected with a high-speed network.
However, supercomputers own extremely, and most of the time exclusively, high technology infrastructure to orchest the combination of hardware architecture and software stack.
